Goal: 

Build an AI-powered assistant that automatically retrieves research papers from multiple sources, processes them, and generates structured literature reviews with key insights using MCP to orchestrate retrieval, summarization, and synthesis into a coherent research overview.

Problem Statement:

Conducting a literature review is time-consuming and cognitively demanding. Researchers must search across multiple databases, extract relevant information from diverse document formats, and synthesize findings into coherent insights. This process often becomes a bottleneck in research, especially when handling large volumes of rapidly evolving academic literature.

Solution Statement:

The AI-Powered Automated Literature Review Assistant leverages LLMs orchestrated via MCP to streamline the entire literature review workflow. The system:

1. Retrieves documents from multiple academic sources (e.g., arXiv, PubMed).

2. Processes and normalizes text for analysis.

3. Summarizes content using LLM-driven abstractive and extractive methods.

4. Generates insights by identifying themes, trends, and research gaps.

5. Synthesizes outputs into structured, human-readable literature reviews.

This solution reduces manual effort, accelerates knowledge discovery, and enables researchers to focus more on analysis and innovation rather than repetitive data handling.
